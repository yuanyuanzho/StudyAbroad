                        <p>The digital age has spurred a demand for professionals in the fields of computing and computer science. Based on the findings of recent reports, the demand isn’t slowing down any time soon, which is great for prospective students who are keen to forge a career in this respected discipline.</p>
                        <p>According to a report from The Complete University Guide, the UK job market is experiencing a shortage of graduates with digital expertise. “In the software industry alone there are 20,000 graduate vacancies a year, and only 7,500 computer science graduates to fill them,” says Hugh Millward, Microsoft’s Director of Corporate Affairs.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, a report by Computer World UK has shown that the most popular jobs of 2017 includes the IT profession, with research by the global IT industry body CompTIA reporting that UK IT staff job postings have increased by 10 percent each year. On top of that, the emerging threats of cyber hacking and identity theft have led to a boost in corporate security measures, with companies worldwide seeking to hire professionals who specialise in cyber security to protect their business assets.</p>
                        <p>If this field is truly of interest to you, a degree in Computing is exactly what you need. A general degree covers many areas, giving students the chance to explore subject areas before selecting their specialisation. Among the most common higher education pathways are disciplines like Computer Science, Cyber Security, Information Technology and Software Engineering. Courses are known to hold a practical-focus, equipping students with subject-specific and transferable skills that make them highly employable graduates.</p>
